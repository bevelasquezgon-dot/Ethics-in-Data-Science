<p>The article titled,”<a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rsta.2016.0119">Data science ethics in government</a>”, explores how the government can use data science to improve public services while minimizing harm. To support ethical innovation the Government Data Science Partnership developed a practical user-focused ethical framework. As part of its development, they ran a public dialogue on data science ethics. Public engagement revealed low awareness of data science with increased support when real-world examples were shown. The public dialogue also found that public approval is context-dependent, so the public’s support varies by case and its potential outcomes. The article also highlights the importance and crucial role of the ethical framework ; while also acknowledging that there is a need for ongoing research in areas like data minimization, algorithmic accountability, and public trust to fully communicate the government’s use of data science for social good.</p>
