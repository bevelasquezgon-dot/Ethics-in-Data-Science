## Abstract 


## Summary 

The article titled,”Data science ethics in government”, explores how the government can use data science to improve public services while minimizing harm. To support ethical innovation the Government Data Science Partnership developed a practical user-focused ethical framework. As part of its development, they ran a public dialogue on data science ethics. Public engagement revealed low awareness of data science with increased support when real-world examples were shown. The public dialogue also found that public approval is context-dependent, so the public's support varies by case and its potential outcomes. The article also highlights the importance and crucial role of the ethical framework ; while also acknowledging that there is a need for ongoing research in areas like data minimization, algorithmic accountability, and public trust to fully communicate the government’s use of data science for social good.
