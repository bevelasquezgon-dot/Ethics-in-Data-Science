## Abstract 


## Article Summary  

The article titled,”Data science ethics in government”, explores how the government can use data science to improve public services while minimizing harm. To support ethical innovation the Government Data Science Partnership developed a practical user-focused ethical framework. As part of its development, they ran a public dialogue on data science ethics. Public engagement revealed low awareness of data science with increased support when real-world examples were shown. The public dialogue also found that public approval is context-dependent, so the public's support varies by case and its potential outcomes. The article also highlights the importance and crucial role of the ethical framework ; while also acknowledging that there is a need for ongoing research in areas like data minimization, algorithmic accountability, and public trust to fully communicate the government’s use of data science for social good. 






### Ethical Dilemmas & Values at Stake

Several ethical issues and dilemmas are discussed in this article. One major conflict lies between public benefit and individual privacy. While personal data could be used to improve public services and policies, conflicts arise amongst people who value individual privacy and transparency raising concerns about awareness and consent. Citizens may also be unaware of how their data is used especially when it is repurposed beyond its original intent which challenges the principle of autonomy, allowing people to make their own decisions without being peer pressured or forced. Another ethical issue rises due to the lack of transparency between data science methods that make it difficult for citizens to understand.  Additionally, because some algorithms may be trained on biased or incomplete data, equity and fairness are also challenged. Lastly, the article makes the point that accountability is a big dilemma as algorithms may make decisions that affect people's lives, but it is not clear who is responsible if errors occur. To summarize, the values at stake are privacy, autonomy, public benefit, fairness, transparency, accountability, security, and trust. 




### Who are the stakeholders? 

When the government uses data science to make decisions, the key stakeholders include citizens, government data scientists and policy makers. Citizens are the group whose data is being used and the decisions have an impact on their lives. Government data scientists are responsible for designing models that make choices that impact the lives of citizens. Policy makers are also stakeholders because they are the ones using the data to make rules and regulations. 

### Analysis using frameworks/concepts 
The ethical challenges discussed in the article can be better understood through established ethical frameworks.

#### Utilitarian Perspective 
From a utilitarian perspective, government data projects aim to maximize the public benefit by improving services and informing policy. Under this framework, government data projects may be justified. However, this approach has the potential to overlook the harm to smaller or marginalized groups which again, raises questions about fairness.


#### Deontological Ethics 
On the other hand, Deontological ethics emphasize duties and individuals rights, regardless of the outcome for the majority. This framework highlights the moral obligation to respect individual rights. It helps maintain meaningful consent and ensures transparency. For example, using personal data without an individual's knowledge or understanding may violate their autonomy even if the government project yields social benefits.  

#### Fairness Metrics 
Additionally, the use of fairness metrics, such as disparate impact, is relevant when assessing if a data-driven decision treats all groups equally. Applying metrics for race, gender, and socio-economic lines may help detect and address these imbalances.

#### Data Minimization 
Finally, privacy principles like the concept of data minimization encourages minimal and purposeful data collection and storage. Government projects access vast datasets but ethical practice demands using only what is essential to reduce risks of misuse. This concept supports trust and security as the over-collection of data increases the risk of misuse. Together these frameworks underscore the need to balance public rights with individual rights to ensure algorithmic fairness and enforce strong data protection practices. 

### Potential Benfits & Harm 

The article highlights various ways that government data science has the potential to deliver significant public benefits. For one, it can enable governments to deliver more responsive and efficient services. It can also help maximize the use of the increasing amount of digital data that is available to provide better insights for policymakers. The use of government data science can also help optimize resource allocations when and where they are most needed. However, government data science may also pose important ethical risks that can vary across stakeholders including citizens, government agencies and vulnerable communities. If individual data is used without proper safeguards or consent the privacy of individuals may be compromised which can lead to reputational damage in the government. Additionally vulnerable communities may be harmed by models trained on biased data leading to profiling. While government data science holds the promise of innovation and improvement of public welfare, it must be done with strong ethical safeguards to prevent harm.

### Steps to mitigate ethical risks 

The article introduces an Ethical Framework Draft that is made up of six main principles.

The first is to start with clear user needs and public benefit. The idea for this principle is that understanding how the public feels about the benefits of each project would help the government  design a project with risks in mind. It is important to state exactly who is benefiting. The public dialogue in the article states that the public is more likely to accept projects where there is a direct personal benefit. This principle could require a public value assessment at the outset of each project which would ensure the use of the data is aligned with societal views as beneficial.

The second principle is to use data and tools that have the minimum intrusion necessary. This data minimization principle is essential to reduce risk and spread public trust. To achieve this there would need to be a limitation on data collection, storage and sharing, this should be followed by confirmation that only essential data is being used.

The third principle is to create robust data science models. This principle is important because not doing so could reinforce bias and discrimination. To enforce this principle one should integrate fairness testing such as the disparate impact analysis and ensure that models are regularly reviewed and tested. 

The fourth principle is to be alert to public perceptions which are dependent on multiple factors such as current events and media presentations. This principle argues for transparency by noting that the public perception of the data science project is highly linked to attitudes to the overall policy. This would mean that there should be accessible transparency on what data is used and for what it is being used so that public perception may not be damaged by other factors.

The fifth principle is to be as open and accountable as possible without putting people at risk. This principle could be put into play by being able to explain how machines are making decisions in plain language.  

The sixth principle is to keep data secure. The article highlights the steps that the government has taken to keep data secure such as creating infrastructure which will hold data more securely and safe havens where administrative data can be stored and used in a safe and strict manner. This ethical framework showcases ways to mitigate risk while building public trust. 

### Framework Limitations 

Although this framework is a valuable foundation, there are a few limitations. First, the framework lacks enforcement mechanisms and may be inconsistent across different cases. Second, there is no formal requirement for engaging affected communities. Third, this framework assumes that government teams have the technical expertise to assess fairness, something that is hard to successfully mitigate. Additionally, there is no strong accountability structure to this framework so some may treat it as optional. To be effective, I suggest that the framework should be followed by a strong regulatory oversight, concrete fairness and privacy tools, and ongoing ethics training and evaluation amongst teams. 

### Discussion Questions 

#### Should governments develop mechanisms to track and respond to problems arising from AI agents acting autonomously? 

The government should develop mechanisms to track and respond to problems arising from AI agents acting autonomously. AI systems make decisions that impact the lives of real people so these decisions have real consequences. There is a growing risk of unintended harm and bias due to the lack of oversight. Without oversight these systems may violate individual rights or reinforce inequality. According to the ethical framework previously discussed, the government has the responsibility of ensuring transparency, fairness and accountability with the use of AI. This includes creating tools that help monitor AI behaviour for preventing harm and for maintaining public trust. 

#### How should risks related to the malicious use of AI be managed? Do you think the government should be involved in managing these risks?

Risk management should not rely on a single technique and it should have the ability to adapt to change. As AI systems are evolving, so are the malicious ways of using AI which is why risk management must also evolve. The government should take an active role in regulating AI by promoting fairness, transparency, and accountability. There should be an emphasis on oversight of AI by humans who follow an ethical framework. Without adaptation to change and by relying on a single technique, AI systems risk reinforcing bias or harmful misuse. 

#### Is there a privacy concern when the government uses citizen’s data to lead policy decisions? Should the government make policies to protect the right to privacy?

There is a privacy concern when the government uses citizens data to lead policy decisions even when the government states that all intentions are good.  The consequences of not having the right to privacy are things like mass surveillance, the loss of anonymity, and misuse of personal information. For these reasons, the government should make policies to protect the right to privacy. These policies should be clear and uphold the public’s trust ensuring transparency.  

#### Is there a bias concern with the data that branches of the government might choose to use to support certain policy decisions?

There is a concern with the data that branches of the government might choose to use to support certain policy decisions. Selecting one dataset over another may lead to the exclusion of certain variables, communities or perspectives. This selective process may skew results leading to the reinforcement of existing inequalities. Due to these issues, it is very important to note why certain data is being left out so that interpretations are not misinterpreted. Transparency in the selection process could ensure that data leading to policies are fair and if it is biased, it is important for policymakers and the government to acknowledge that fact. 

#### Should we be concerned about other countries using the data of US citizens? Should the US have a role in reducing this risk? (Consider the TikTok ban)

Citizens of any country should be concerned about other countries having access to their personal data. There are serious privacy, security, and sovereignty issues at stake when foreign governments or companies can collect and use the personal data of people from another country. There are risks such as surveillance and misuse of such data that is hard to claim back once a foreign country already has access to it. If a foreign company mishandles or misuses data, U.S. citizens have limited legal protection against it. For example, Tiktok became a popular dilemma because of its ownership by the Chinese company ByteDance. This raised concerns about where the data of U.S citizens goes and who can access it. However, banning the Tiktok app because of these concerns does not address the root cause of any of the risks mentioned. In fact there are other apps that impose the same risks because they also store and collect data from U.S. citizens.To truly protect citizens’ data the U.S should play an active role in setting and enforcing data policies, not only within its borders but also internationally through cross-border data agreements. The deeper issue lies in the lack of absence of strong federal data privacy protections.
