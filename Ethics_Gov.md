<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>This ethical case study analysis examines the use of data science in the government, focusing on both its potential benefits and the ethical risks associated with it.  While data-driven technologies may enhance public policy, public services and decision-making, they also raise concerns related to privacy, bias, transparency and the autonomous behavior of AI systems. Key ethical issues include the potential for discriminatory outcomes and the risk of malicious or unintended uses of data for AI technology. This paper argues that the government should actively develop actionable frameworks to monitor AI behavior and manage the risks of misuse. Limitations of the ethical framework creating by the article “Data science ethics in government” are also noted and recommendations are made.</p>
<h2 id="article-summary">Article Summary</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/bevelasquezgon-dot/Ethics-in-Data-Science#article-summary"></a></p>
<p>The article titled,”<a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rsta.2016.0119">Data science ethics in government</a>”, explores how the government can use data science to improve public services while minimizing harm. To support ethical innovation the Government Data Science Partnership developed a practical user-focused ethical framework. As part of its development, they ran a public dialogue on data science ethics. Public engagement revealed low awareness of data science with increased support when real-world examples were shown. The public dialogue also found that public approval is context-dependent, so the public’s support varies by case and its potential outcomes. The article also highlights the importance and crucial role of the ethical framework ; while also acknowledging that there is a need for ongoing research in areas like data minimization, algorithmic accountability, and public trust to fully communicate the government’s use of data science for social good.</p>
<h3 id="ethical-dilemmas--values-at-stake">Ethical Dilemmas &amp; Values at Stake</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/bevelasquezgon-dot/Ethics-in-Data-Science#ethical-dilemmas--values-at-stake"></a></p>
<p>Several ethical issues and dilemmas are discussed in this article. One major conflict lies between public benefit and individual privacy. While personal data could be used to improve public services and policies, conflicts arise amongst people who value individual privacy and transparency further raising concerns about awareness and consent. Citizens may also be unaware of how their data is used especially when it is repurposed beyond its original intent which challenges the principle of autonomy, allowing people to make their own decisions without being peer pressured or forced. Another ethical issue rises due to the lack of transparency between data science methods that make it difficult for citizens to understand. Additionally, because some algorithms may be trained on biased or incomplete data, equity and fairness are also challenged. Lastly, the article makes the point that accountability is a big dilemma as algorithms may make decisions that affect people’s lives, but it is not clear who is responsible if errors occur. To summarize, some of the values at stake are privacy, autonomy, public benefit, fairness, transparency, accountability, security, and trust.</p>
<h3 id="who-are-the-stakeholders">Who are the stakeholders?</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/bevelasquezgon-dot/Ethics-in-Data-Science#who-are-the-stakeholders"></a></p>
<p>When the government uses data science to make decisions, the key stakeholders are citizens, government data scientists and policy makers. Citizens are the group whose data is being used and the decisions have an impact on their lives. Government data scientists are responsible for designing the models that make choices that impact the lives of citizens. Policy makers are also stakeholders because they are the ones using the data to make rules and regulations.</p>
<h3 id="analysis-using-established-frameworksconcepts">Analysis using established frameworks/concepts</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/bevelasquezgon-dot/Ethics-in-Data-Science#analysis-using-frameworksconcepts"></a></p>
<p>The ethical challenges discussed in the article can be analyzed using established ethical frameworks.</p>
<h4 id="utilitarian-perspective">Utilitarian Perspective</h4>
<p><a href="https://github.com/bevelasquezgon-dot/Ethics-in-Data-Science#utilitarian-perspective"></a></p>
<p>Utilitarian states that an action is right if it leads to the most happiness / pleasure for the greater number of people.<br>
From a utilitarian perspective, government data projects aim to maximize the public benefit by improving services and informing policy. Under this framework, government data projects may be justified, however, this approach has the potential to overlook the harm to smaller or marginalized groups which raises questions about fairness.</p>
<h4 id="deontological-ethics">Deontological Ethics</h4>
<p><a href="https://github.com/bevelasquezgon-dot/Ethics-in-Data-Science#deontological-ethics"></a></p>
<p>Deontology is an ethical theory that says an action is considered morally good because of some characteristic of the action itself, not because the consequences of the action are good.<br>
It emphasize duties and individuals rights, regardless of the outcome for the majority. This framework highlights the moral obligation to respect individual rights. It helps maintain meaningful consent and ensures transparency. For example, using personal data without an individual’s knowledge or understanding may violate their autonomy even if the government project yields social benefits.</p>
<h4 id="fairness-metrics">Fairness Metrics</h4>
<p><a href="https://github.com/bevelasquezgon-dot/Ethics-in-Data-Science#fairness-metrics"></a></p>
<p>The use of fairness metrics such as disparate impact, is relevant when assessing if a data-driven decision treats all groups equally. A technique like Disparate Impact Remover is able to  manipulate the data before training the model to reduce bias. Specifically, it adjusts feature values to enhance group fairness while preserving group rank ordering. This helps improve group fairness without significantly sacrificing model accuracy, aligning the system with ethical and equitable standards.</p>
<h4 id="data-minimization">Data Minimization</h4>
<p><a href="https://github.com/bevelasquezgon-dot/Ethics-in-Data-Science#data-minimization"></a></p>
<p>Privacy principles like the concept of data minimization encourages minimal and purposeful data collection and storage. Government projects access vast datasets but ethical practice demands using only what is essential to reduce risks of misuse. This concept supports trust and security as the over-collection of data increases the risk of misuse.</p>
<p>Together these frameworks underscore the need to balance public benefits of data science in the government with individual rights to ensure algorithmic fairness and enforce strong data protection practices.</p>
<h3 id="potential-benefits--harm">Potential Benefits &amp; Harm</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/bevelasquezgon-dot/Ethics-in-Data-Science#potential-benfits--harm"></a></p>
<p>There are various ways that data science in the government has the potential to deliver significant public benefits.</p>
<p>For one, it can enable governments to deliver more responsive and efficient services. An example is using data science to detect unusual patterns that indicate fraud or the misuse of public funds by using anomaly detection algorithms. This model could help tax authorities use data models to identify suspicious claims or inconsistencies in tax returns which could save the public money.</p>
<p>It can also help maximize the use of the increasing amount of digital data that is available to provide better insights for policymakers. For example, the U.S. Department of Education could use data on test scores, attendance, and graduation rates to identify underperforming schools which supports evidence-based decisions on curriculum or program.s</p>
<p>The use of government data science can also help optimize resource allocations when and where they are most needed.<br>
For example, the governerment could analyze historical and real-time data to anticipate emergency hotspots and allocate ambulances accordingly. This could decrease the average ambulance response time and improve patient outcomes due to faster medical attention.</p>
<p>However, it may also pose important ethical risks that can vary across stakeholders including citizens, government agencies and vulnerable communities. If personal data is used without proper safeguards or consent, the privacy of individuals may be compromised. This could lead be to a loss of public trust, harm to citizens, and even  reputational damage to the government.<br>
For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, several governments implemented contact tracing apps that collected personal data without sufficient transparency or clear consent. Some systems were later criticized for enabling surveillance beyond their intended use.<br>
Additionally vulnerable communities may be disproportionately affected by models trained on biased data, potentially resulting in discrimination or profiling. An example would be the use of predictive policing algorithms which could biased on historical crime data and disproportionately target communities of color further reinforcing systematic inequalities.</p>
<p>To address these risks, governments should implement strong ethical safeguards such as transparent data governance, regular bias audits, and the use of fairness metrics like disparate impact. While data science offers significant potential for innovation and improvement of public services, it must be used and applied responsibly to ensure fairness, accountability and the protection of individual rights.</p>
<h3 id="steps-to-mitigate-ethical-risks">Steps to mitigate ethical risks</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/bevelasquezgon-dot/Ethics-in-Data-Science#steps-to-mitigate-ethical-risks"></a></p>
<p>The article introduces an Ethical Framework Draft that is made up of six main principles. This section builds on these principles by incorporating<br>
public concerns related to transparency, explainability and accountability.</p>
<ol>
<li>Start with Clear User Needs and Public Benefit</li>
</ol>
<p>This principle emphasizes the importance of grounding data science projects with clearly defined public needs and demonstrable societal benefits.<br>
Understanding public expectations and  values of the public  would help the government design projects with ethical risks in mind. It is also  essential to clearly state who will  benefit from the project. According to the public dialogue in the article,  the public is more likely to accept projects where there is a direct personal benefit. With this information in mind, one could argue that<br>
there should be a public value assessment at the outset of each project to ensure alignment with public expectations and ethical use of data.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Use Data and Tools that have the Minimum Intrusion Necessary</li>
</ol>
<p>This principle reflects the importance of data minimization which encourages minimal and purposeful data collection and storage. Limiting data access reduces potential misuse, protects individual privacy, and fosters public trust.<br>
Safegaurds should be implemented to confirm that only essential data is being used and that it is not retained longer than needed.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Create Robust Data Science Models</li>
</ol>
<p>Robust models are critical to prevent reinforcing existing biases and inequalities.<br>
To uphold this principle, there should be regular bias audits and the use of fairness metrics such as disparate impact analysis<br>
to identify and mitigate biased outcomes in the model. Models should also be<br>
regularly reviewed and evaluated for accuracy and performance across different groups and communities.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Be Alert to Public Perceptions</li>
</ol>
<p>Public perceptions of government data use are influenced by multiple factors such as current events and media narratives. This principle stresses the importance for transparency which is the ability to clearly describe the intended use, functioning, and limitations of AI models. Public concerns can be addressed through accessible explanations of how data is collected and used. This supports public engagement and helps maintain trust in policy decisions that are supported by data science.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Be as Open and Accountable as Possible Without Putting People at Risk</li>
</ol>
<p>This principle focuses on accountability and explainability. Governments must ensure that decisions made with the help of AI are traceable, and that there is always a human or institution responsible for outcomes. To incorporate explainability means that methods can be explained by using plain-langauge to describe how algorithms reach their conclusions. Furthermore, openness must be balanced with the need to protect sensitive information.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>Keep Data Secure</li>
</ol>
<p>The article outlines the steps taken by the government to enhance data security.   This includes investing in secure infrastructure and the use of “safe havens” for storing and accessing administrative data. These measures help prevent unauthorized access to ensure compliance with legal standards and to reinforce public confidence in how data is handled.</p>
<h3 id="framework-limitations">Framework Limitations</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/bevelasquezgon-dot/Ethics-in-Data-Science#framework-limitations"></a></p>
<p>Although the ethical framework is a valuable foundation, there are notable limitations that may hinder its effectiveness in practice.</p>
<p>First, the framework lacks clear enforcement mechanisms and may be inconsistent across different cases. While it outlines guiding principles, there are no binding rules or legal obligations that ensure that the government agencies apply them. This lack of enforceability could lead to inconsistencies in how the framework is implemented across departments.</p>
<p>Second, there is no formal requirement for public or community engagement. Vulnerable communities who may be disproportionately affects by biased models are not guaranteed a say in the design or oversight of these systems. This risks reinforcing power imbalance.</p>
<p>Third, this framework assumes that government teams already have the technical expertise to evaluate fairness, bias, and explainability in AI systems. In reality, some teams may not have the specialized knowledge or tools required to conduct fairness metrics which could lead to inconsistency or superficial assessments.</p>
<p>Fourth, there is no robust accountability structure to this framework so some may treat it as optional. This undermine the ability to drive meaningful change in practice.</p>
<h3 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h3>
<ul>
<li>Establish regular oversight</li>
<li>Mandate public and community engagement</li>
<li>Integrate concrete tools for fairness and privacy</li>
<li>Invest in ongoing ethics training and evaluation</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="discussion-questions">Discussion Questions</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/bevelasquezgon-dot/Ethics-in-Data-Science#discussion-questions"></a></p>
<h4 id="should-governments-develop-mechanisms-to-track-and-respond-to-problems-arising-from-ai-agents-acting-autonomously">Should governments develop mechanisms to track and respond to problems arising from AI agents acting autonomously?</h4>
<p><a href="https://github.com/bevelasquezgon-dot/Ethics-in-Data-Science#should-governments-develop-mechanisms-to-track-and-respond-to-problems-arising-from-ai-agents-acting-autonomously"></a></p>
<p>The government should develop mechanisms to track and respond to problems arising from AI agents acting autonomously. AI systems make decisions that impact the lives of real people so these decisions have real consequences. There is a growing risk of unintended harm and bias due to the lack of oversight. Without oversight these systems may violate individual rights or reinforce inequality. According to the ethical framework previously discussed, the government has the responsibility of ensuring transparency, fairness and accountability with the use of AI. This includes creating tools that help monitor AI behaviour for preventing harm and for maintaining public trust.</p>
<h4 id="how-should-risks-related-to-the-malicious-use-of-ai-be-managed-do-you-think-the-government-should-be-involved-in-managing-these-risks">How should risks related to the malicious use of AI be managed? Do you think the government should be involved in managing these risks?</h4>
<p><a href="https://github.com/bevelasquezgon-dot/Ethics-in-Data-Science#how-should-risks-related-to-the-malicious-use-of-ai-be-managed-do-you-think-the-government-should-be-involved-in-managing-these-risks"></a></p>
<p>Risk management should not rely on a single technique and it should have the ability to adapt to change. As AI systems are evolving, so are the malicious ways of using AI which is why risk management must also evolve. The government should take an active role in regulating AI by promoting fairness, transparency, and accountability. There should be an emphasis on oversight of AI by humans who follow an ethical framework. Without adaptation to change and by relying on a single technique, AI systems risk reinforcing bias or harmful misuse.</p>
<h4 id="is-there-a-privacy-concern-when-the-government-uses-citizen’s-data-to-lead-policy-decisions-should-the-government-make-policies-to-protect-the-right-to-privacy">Is there a privacy concern when the government uses citizen’s data to lead policy decisions? Should the government make policies to protect the right to privacy?</h4>
<p><a href="https://github.com/bevelasquezgon-dot/Ethics-in-Data-Science#is-there-a-privacy-concern-when-the-government-uses-citizens-data-to-lead-policy-decisions-should-the-government-make-policies-to-protect-the-right-to-privacy"></a></p>
<p>There is a privacy concern when the government uses citizens data to lead policy decisions even when the government states that all intentions are good. The consequences of not having the right to privacy are things like mass surveillance, the loss of anonymity, and misuse of personal information. For these reasons, the government should make policies to protect the right to privacy. These policies should be clear and uphold the public’s trust ensuring transparency.</p>
<h4 id="is-there-a-bias-concern-with-the-data-that-branches-of-the-government-might-choose-to-use-to-support-certain-policy-decisions">Is there a bias concern with the data that branches of the government might choose to use to support certain policy decisions?</h4>
<p><a href="https://github.com/bevelasquezgon-dot/Ethics-in-Data-Science#is-there-a-bias-concern-with-the-data-that-branches-of-the-government-might-choose-to-use-to-support-certain-policy-decisions"></a></p>
<p>There is a concern with the data that branches of the government might choose to use to support certain policy decisions. Selecting one dataset over another may lead to the exclusion of certain variables, communities or perspectives. This selective process may skew results leading to the reinforcement of existing inequalities. Due to these issues, it is very important to note why certain data is being left out so that interpretations are not misinterpreted. Transparency in the selection process could ensure that data leading to policies are fair and if it is biased, it is important for policymakers and the government to acknowledge that fact.</p>
<h4 id="should-we-be-concerned-about-other-countries-using-the-data-of-us-citizens-should-the-us-have-a-role-in-reducing-this-risk-consider-the-tiktok-ban">Should we be concerned about other countries using the data of US citizens? Should the US have a role in reducing this risk? (Consider the TikTok ban)</h4>
<p><a href="https://github.com/bevelasquezgon-dot/Ethics-in-Data-Science#should-we-be-concerned-about-other-countries-using-the-data-of-us-citizens-should-the-us-have-a-role-in-reducing-this-risk-consider-the-tiktok-ban"></a></p>
<p>Any citizen should be concerned about foreign countries having access to their personal data. There are serious privacy, security, and sovereignty issues at stake when foreign governments or companies can collect and use the personal data of people from another country. There are risks such as surveillance and misuse of such data that is hard to claim back once a foreign country already has access to it.<br>
It would also be hard to have legal protection against foreign companies that mishandle or misuse data. Tiktok in the U.S became a popular dilemma because of its ownership by the Chinese company ByteDance. There were concerns about where the data of U.S citizens goes and who can access it. However, banning the Tiktok app because of these concerns does not address the root cause of any of the risks mentioned. In fact there are other apps that impose the same risks because they also store and collect data from U.S. citizens. To truly protect citizens’ data the U.S should play an active role in setting and enforcing data policies, not only within its borders but also internationally through cross-border data agreements. The deeper issue lies in the lack of absence of strong federal data privacy protections</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>This ethical case study analysis has explored the growing role of data science in government, highlighting both its potential and ethical challenges.<br>
While data-driven technologies can enhance public services, policy-making, and resource allocation, they also raise critical concerns about privacy, bias, and transparency of AI systems. Without proper safeguards, these technologies risk producing discriminatory outcomes or being misused in harmful ways.</p>
<p>The Ethical Framework Draft introduced in the article is an important step toward responsible and value-driven innovation in the public sector. However, as this analysis has shown, the framework has its limitations. This includes the lack of enforcement mechanisms, structured community engagement, technical capacity assumptions and clear accountability structures.</p>
<p>To address these gaps, the ethical framework proposed in this paper builds upon and adds to the original article’s framework. It integrates key concepts such as transparency, explainable AI, and accountability. It also provides recommendations such as regular oversight, the adoption of fairness and privacy tools, and ethics training for data science teams.</p>
<p>Ultimately, ethics in data science for the government is not only a technical requirement but also a social responsibility. Embedding ethics into data science is essential to ensure that data and AI are used in the right ways. Future work should evaluate real world implementations of ethical frameworks across different government agencies to provide valuable insights into what works and what does not.</p>
